# Hohmann_Transfer_Orbit_V1

This Python application calculates and visualizes Hohmann transfer orbits around various celestial bodies in our solar system, including planets, moons, and dwarf planets. The program uses the gravitational parameters of these bodies to compute the time of flight for a spacecraft traveling between two orbits (inner and outer). It also plots the orbits and transfer path in a 2D projection using Matplotlib and Tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI).

## Requirements
Python 3.11

numpy

matplotlib

tkinter

## Installation
Clone this repository and install the required dependencies using:

```
pip install numpy matplotlib tk
```

## Usage
Run the program and input the radii of the orbits (inner and outer), choose the unit (AU or kilometers), and select the central body. The app will compute the Hohmann transfer time and display the visualized orbits.
